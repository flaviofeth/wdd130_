    <h2>Flavio Feth</h2>  
    <p>Hello. I live in Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada. Living here we can understand what a really cold and long winter means.  I'm an accountant and I'm currently working in a financial institution.
    I like reading, particulary biographies and science-fiction (Isaac Asimov was the best!). I was baptized when I was 10 years old; that means, a long time ago!
    I had the privilege to serve a full time mission. Two years after, the blessing of a marriage in a temple of the Lord with my wonderful wife.
    We have six children. </p>
    <p>In BYU-I, I am working, as a first step, to get my certificate in Web and Computer Programming. It's my first experience ever in that field of knowledge. </p>
